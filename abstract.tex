Modern memory-managed runtimes must efficiently balance memory allocation across dynamically changing workloads, especially when operating under constrained DRAM environments. TeraHeap enhances the G1 Garbage Collector by logically the Java heap into two regions: H1, optimized for GC-managed short-lived objects, and H2, used for longer-lived data with reduced GC overheads. However, TeraHeap statically relies on a fixed total heap size and does not adapt to variations in application memory pressure or available system resources.

In this work, we extend TeraHeap with a dynamic heap resizer that adjusts the overall Java heap size at runtime based on GC behavior and I/O performance trends. Our resizer uses a lightweight policy engine that periodically monitors metrics such as GC pause times and page cache pressure to decide whether to grow or shrink the heap. This dynamic resizing mechanism is fully integrated into the OpenJDKâ€™s G1 TeraHeap implementation and requires no manual tuning or application-specific knowledge.

We evaluate our system on Lucene, a widely used full-text search engine, under varied memory-constrained scenarios. Our results show that the dynamic heap resizer improves adaptability and performance stability across workloads. It effectively reclaims memory during idle periods to reduce system pressure and reallocates heap space under load to maintain throughput, outperforming the baseline TeraHeap configuration in both responsiveness and efficiency.
