\begin{abstract}
  TeraHeap \cite{teraheap_asplos} is a dual heap memory management system designed to support tiered memory 
by partitioning the DRAM budget between two heaps: The fast heap (H1), which resides on-heap
and the remote heap (H2), which is backed by a remote file and accessed through the operating system's page cache.
This division is managed statically which can lead to memory pressure on H1 while H2 remains underutilized,
while the excess memory could be transfered over to H1 reducing the pressure, or vice versa.

In this thesis, we address this problem by integrating a dynamic DRAM partitioning mechanism into the 
G1-based version of TeraHeap \cite{mairh_thesis, melidonis_thesis}. We port FlexHeap \cite{flexheap}, 
a resizing policy designed to monitor runtime memory behavior
and adjust the DRAM split between H1 and H2 accordingly. By enabling adaptive heap resizing, 
we aim to improve memory utilization and optimize both garbage collection and I/O overheads,
under dynamic workloads with shifting memory demands.
