  abstract  = {Garbage-First is a server-style garbage collector, targeted for multi-processors with large memories, that meets a soft real-time goal with high probability, while achieving high throughput. Whole-heap operations, such as global marking, are performed concurrently with mutation, to prevent interruptions proportional to heap or live-data size. Concurrent marking both provides collection completeness and identifies regions ripe for reclamation via compacting evacuation. This evacuation is performed in parallel on multiprocessors, to increase throughput.},

  address={Heraklion, Greece},
  abstract={This thesis examines how TeraHeap empowers Lucene to expand its query cache over NVMe SSDs with minimal code modifications, eliminating serialization/deserialization overhead and reducing garbage collection (GC) costs. TeraHeap extends the JVM to utilize a secondary high-capacity heap (H2) over fast storage, offloading objects from DRAM to SSD while avoiding GC scans, thus improving throughput and execution efficiency by up to 22\%.},
