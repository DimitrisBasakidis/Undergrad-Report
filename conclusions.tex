\section{Conclusions}
In modern hybrid heap setups, large-scale search engines such as 
Lucene exhibit dynamic variations in memory requirements between 
the DRAM-managed heap and the I/O cache. The conventional approach of statically dividing DRAM
between these two tiers is inadequate for addressing such demands, 
leading to performance bottlenecks. In this
work, we propose and evaluate the Dynamic Heap Resizer, a lightweight runtime
mechanism that continuously reallocates DRAM between the managed heap and the
H2 page cache based on GC and I/O costs. Our evaluation on representative Lucene
query workloads demonstrates that the Dynamic Heap Resizer adapts efficiently 
to changing memory and I/O patterns, improving execution time by up to 15.8\% 
compared to static 50-50 partitioning and 13.4\% compared to the ideal configurations, without requiring manual tuning. Overall, 
dynamic memory resizing offers an effective solution to to reduce the execution time 
of Lucene under constrained DRAM budgets.
